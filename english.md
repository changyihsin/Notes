I don't have a problem with him **keep in touch ** his family whilst he's posted overseas and sending e-mails in office time. That's not the main issue. However, if he thinks he can sending **get away with**such abusive e-mails to colleagues, he is sadly mistaken and he'll have
to face the consequences of his actions later. He is clearly **making things up**  about his colleagues and spreading nasty rumours. He'd be better off speaking to colleagues **face to face** if he has problems with them. He's slightly better when speaking with customers, but he needs to  **get away with** think about who he's speaking to when he's **pitching** our products to them. And he just doesn't know how to say no to people without  **causing offence**.
