I don't have a problem with him **keep in touch ** his family whilst he's posted overseas and sending e-mails in office time. That's not the main issue. However, if he thinks he can sending **get away with**such abusive e-mails to colleagues, he is sadly mistaken and he'll have

I am an inhibited person when talking in public space using foreign language. As I wrote in my previous article, being a good communicator depending on several factors. The most important one could be fluent in the language. I don't have extensive vocabulary. It makes me difficult to describe thing in a concise or succinct way. I am afraid of making a mistakes while talking to public.     

Having a creative idea is important  if you want to establish a stock-up company. You may come out some vague ideas suddenly. Remember to write them down and review each ideas.
