 - WiFi direct APIs improvement
 - WiFi emulator support in KK
 - NFC emulator support in KK
 - **New security model development**
 - RTSP test cases
 - **Performance improvement**
	 - add performance marker gecko API
	 - put performance marker to identify the performance bottleneck for each WiFi, NFC and RTSP if necessary. 
 - **Multi screen**
 - Necko study group
 - RTSP refactor plan
 - **New gonk interface to have better support for** 
	 - Cross platform
	 - easy porting to different platform
	 - improve test coverage
	 - WiFi
		 - Current hardware/software requirements:
			- Linux kernel 2.4.x or 2.6.x with Linux Wireless Extensions v15 or newer
			-  FreeBSD 6-CURRENT
			- NetBSD-current
			- Microsoft Windows with WinPcap (at least WinXP, may work with other versions)
			- drivers:
				 - Linux drivers that support cfg80211/nl80211.
					 -  Even though there are number of driver specific interface included in wpa_supplicant, please note that Linux drivers are moving to use generic wireless configuration interface driver_nl80211 (-Dnl80211 on wpa_supplicant command line) should be the default option to start with before falling back to driver specific interface. Linux drivers that support WPA/WPA2 configuration with the generic Linux wireless extensions (WE-18 or newer). Obsoleted by nl80211. In theory, any driver that supports Linux wireless extensions can be used with IEEE 802.1X (i.e., not WPA) when using ap_scan=0 option in configuration file.
				 - Wired Ethernet drivers (with ap_scan=0)
				 - BSD net80211 layer (e.g., Atheros driver) 
					 - At the moment, this is for FreeBSD 6-CURRENT branch and NetBSD-current.
				 - Windows NDIS
					 - The current Windows port requires WinPcap (http://winpcap.polito.it/). See README-Windows.txt for more information.  
	 - RTSP
		 - Add test cases
		 - move to content process
		 - eliminate the dependency for libstagefright
	 - NFC
		 - Test coverage
